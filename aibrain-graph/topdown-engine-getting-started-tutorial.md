# TopDown Engine - Getting Started Tutorial

**Note**: To get you started using the AI Brain Graph, you should first follow the [Install instructions](../install-instructions.md) and check that everything is working.

### The Tutorial Scene

First of all, look for the _AIBrain\_Tutorial_ scene \(and open it\), that will serve as a starting point for this tutorial. Basically, it is the TopDown _RetroAI_ scene with all enemies removed \(with the exception of _RetroSwordsman_\).

1. Open the _Enemies_ group to check the content: you will find the _RetroSwordsman_ prefab and two other gameObjects \(stripped out of all AI components\): _RetroSwordsmanGenerated_ and _RetroSwordsmanPluggable._
